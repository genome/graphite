# apipe-metrics-daemon

This is a command that runs on `apipe-metrics.gsc.wustl.edu` to poll various
metrics based on SQL queries.

## Updating

1. Commit your changes to Genome::Model::Tools::ApipeMetricsDaemon.
2. Update the `debian/changelog`.  You can use `dch -v $NEXT_VERSION` to
   prepare template.
3. Build the package using standard build tools, e.g. `dpkg-buildpackage`.  We
   don't worry about dependencies for this package so you don't have to use a VM.
4. Upload the package using our standard process, e.g. using `dput`.
5. `apipe-metrics.gsc.wustl.edu` should automatically get updated just as we
   would expect for `genome-snapshot-deps`.
